I am a Postdoctoral Prize Research Fellow in Sociology at <a href="https://www.nuffield.ox.ac.uk/people/profiles/kasimir-dederichs/">Nuffield College</a> at the University of Oxford. In my research, I study how socio-demographic similarities and differences structure social integration in diversifying European societies. I focus on three different, yet related settings where individuals may experience diversity through interacting with others from their own or other backgrounds: civic organizations (e.g., sports clubs, cultural associations), neighborhoods, and coresidential partnerships (i.e., romantic unions). With this research agenda, I aim to contribute to a better understanding of the drivers and consequences of social integration across different life-domains.

My work on civic organizations studies their potential for stimulating mixing across group boundaries such as socioeconomic status, gender, and ethnicity as key dimension of social inequality. My Ph.D. thesis entitled "Who (else) is Involved? How Voluntary Associations Connect and Separate Us?" includes four chapters that examine (i) how gender segregation structures civic life, how the socio-economic composition of individuals ego-centric networks change after joining civic organizations, (iii) how participatory inequalities change as adolescents grow older, and (iv) how ethnic segregation unfolds both between and within civic organizations. It won the 'Best Dissertation Award' of the German Academy of Sociology and received the second place for the ECSR's 'Best Thesis Award'.

In my work on neighborhoods, I examine patterns of residential segregation and study in how far individuals prefer to reside in places where their neighbors are similar to themselves regarding age, ethnicity and education level. I compare these patterns to the organizational context, too.

A final strand of my work focuses on partner choice in ethnically diverse contexts. Using full-population register data from the Netherlands, I examine, among other things, partnership formation between different minority groups, long-term singlehood as an outcome of the partner search process, and the partner choices of individuals of mixed ethnic backgrounds.

<p>
In my research, I employ a variety of quantitative research methods, including a range of fixed effects models (with fixed effects for individuals, families, or organizations), conjoint experiments, conditional logit models for modelling choices, and other regression-based models.

Before coming to Oxford, I obtained my B.Sc. and M.Sc. at the University of Cologne. I have also visited the Netherlands Interdisciplinary Demographic Institute and Utrecht University for a research stay and spent a semester at the University of Groningen.
