I am a Postdoctoral Prize Research Fellow in Sociology at <a href="https://www.nuffield.ox.ac.uk/people/profiles/kasimir-dederichs/">Nuffield College</a> at the University of Oxford. I am also an Associate member of the <a href="https://www.sociology.ox.ac.uk/people/kasimir-dederichs">Department of Sociology</a>. In my research, I study social integration in diversifying European societies. I focus on three different settings where individuals may experience diversity through interacting with others from their own or other backgrounds: civic organizations (e.g., sports clubs, cultural associations), neighborhoods, and coresidential partnerships (i.e., romantic unions). 
</p>
<p>
My work on civic organizations studies their potential for stimulating mixing across group boundaries such as socioeconomic status, gender, and ethnicity as key dimension of social inequality. My Ph.D. thesis entitled "Who (else) is Involved? How Voluntary Associations Connect and Separate Us?" includes four chapters that examine (i) how gender segregation structures civic life, how the socio-economic composition of individuals ego-centric networks change after joining civic organizations, (iii) how participatory inequalities change as adolescents grow older, and (iv) how ethnic segregation unfolds both between and within civic organizations. My thesis won the biennial <a href="https://www.akademie-soziologie.de/blog/aus-der-akademie/#dissertationspreis-2025-der-akademie-fuer-soziologie-geht-an-kasimir-dederichs">Best Dissertation Award</a> of the German Academy of Sociology and was ranked second for <a href="https://ecsrnet.eu/ecsr-prize-for-best-phd-thesis/">Best Thesis Award</a> of the European Consortium for Sociological Research.

<p>
In my work on neighborhoods, I examine patterns of residential segregation and study in how far individuals prefer to reside in places where their neighbors are similar to themselves regarding age, ethnicity and education level. I compare these patterns to the organizational context, too. 
</p>
<p>
A final strand of my work focuses on partner choice in ethnically diverse contexts. Using full-population register data from the Netherlands, I examine, among other things, partnership formation between different minority groups, long-term singlehood as an outcome of the partner search process, and the partner choices of individuals of mixed ethnic backgrounds. 
</p>
<p>
In my research, I employ a variety of quantitative research methods, including a range of fixed effects models, conjoint experiments, conditional logit models, and other regression-based models.  
</p>
<p>
Prior to my current position, I was a PhD student at Nuffield College and obtained my B.Sc. and M.Sc. at the University of Cologne. I have also visited the Netherlands Interdisciplinary Demographic Institute and Utrecht University for research stays and spent a semester at the University of Groningen.
